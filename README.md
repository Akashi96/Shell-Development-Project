# Shell-Development-Project
This project contains C++ code for the creation of a unix shell. The shell will most likely be a subset of the BASH.
Please refer the PDF included with other files to understand what shell really is, and what does it comprise of.
More content will be added as the project advances.

We hope we will be able to complete it in time. :)
